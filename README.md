# Navier-Stokes
Solve the Navier-Stokes system using CFD model in Python.
Trying to improve my research about climate changes and the dynamic of the southern pacific ocean, I'm trying to apply this model to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, which will be very useful in my research.
This model uses the linear convection equation in 1D to start the practice.
